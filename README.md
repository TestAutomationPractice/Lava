Changes Encountered

>**API**
	>*The API endpoint /movie was the endpoint working. No other 	
	 endpoint was working.*
	 	        **How Team Lava Handled it**
	        >Created the Request/Response models for the API based on 	 
	        the Swagger documentation available. So initially the Tests fails 
	        but then when the API were up and running ,the test cases 	
	        Passed
	        	        
>**UI/Web**
>*Profile and Movie Link was interchanged.*
>*Cancel a rented movie option was not available.*
>*Add new movie functionality was not working.*
>*Clicking on **view more** for a movie is returning same movie.*
>*Categories section is unable to select manually*
        **How Team Lava Handled it**
	        >We created Common Utilities for object Identification. So the fix was to update it at one place so it would reflect automatically.
